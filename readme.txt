Hey guys, this is a project I put together to learn JS. 
I based quite a bit on Mary Rose Cook's Space invaders live-code. 
so here's her site http://maryrosecook.com, I don't think I'll
come back to this project much from here on in unless some 
major specification change breaks it.  I am very aware that I didn't 
comment half of the code.  I'm bad about that.

lastly, I got the music from Free Music Archives, with Matt Nida as the
artist of the chiptune song "Flesheaters" license under an 
Attribution-Non Commercial-Share Alike 3.0 license.
